## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - For bundling -[PUG](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - View Engine
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styling

### What I learned

Using unicode instead of SVG or font-awesome icons. Building a simple project with parceljs and usign pug as the view engine along with sass for styling. Some hickups (sass HMR worked but styles wasn't compiling or being loaded on hard reload) along the way when building, but the documentation from parceljs was helpful.
